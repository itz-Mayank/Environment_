Is the Environmental Monitoring Dashboard loading correctly? Can you see the temperature, air quality, and humidity metrics along with the location map?

I notice you already have an Environmental-Sustainability repository and want to enhance it with features similar to aqi.in/dashboard. I'll help you build a comprehensive environmental monitoring dashboard with real-time data visualization, alerts, and predictions.

First, let's check if the current structure is working and then add the enhanced features you requested.

To fetch real-time weather and air quality data, we need an OpenWeather API key:

Go to https://openweathermap.org/api
Sign up for a free account
Get your API key from the My API Keys section
This key will be used to fetch real-time weather and air quality data for locations worldwide.

I'm having some technical issues getting your environmental dashboard to display properly. I've simplified the app to diagnose the problem, but we're still encountering some setup issues. Would you like me to try a fresh approach to building your dashboard with the air quality, water quality, and weather features you requested?

[plugin:vite:css] [postcss] It looks like you're trying to use tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install @tailwindcss/postcss and update your PostCSS configuration.
at Re (/home/runner/workspace/node_modules/tailwindcss/dist/lib.js:33:1723)
at LazyResult.runOnRoot (/home/runner/workspace/node_modules/postcss/lib/lazy-result.js:361:16)
at LazyResult.runAsync (/home/runner/workspace/node_modules/postcss/lib/lazy-result.js:290:26)

Click outside, press Esc key, or fix the code to dismiss.
You can also disable this overlay by setting server.hmr.overlay to false in vite.config.js.

We're encountering persistent issues with the Tailwind CSS setup that are preventing the dashboard from rendering. Would you like to proceed with one of these alternatives?

Continue with a simpler CSS approach first (without Tailwind) to get the core functionality working, then add Tailwind later
Start fresh with a new project template that has Tailwind CSS pre-configured
Try using a different CSS framework that might be more compatible with the current setup
You can also use the rollback button in the chat pane to return to the last working state if you'd prefer to try a different approach from there.

How would you like to proceed?
